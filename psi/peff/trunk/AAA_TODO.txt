
Specification:
- Review and refine
- Add elements to support proteogenomics?

Controlled vocabulary
- review and refine all terms
- Consider adding:
  Processed vs chain etc.
  
exon
  
intron
  
5'UTR

  3'UTR

  ...
- Decide whether all this should go into the PSI-MS or standalone

Example file:
- Update to be fully compliant with the new decisions
- Manually add some elements shows the easy stuff and fully encodes the tricky stuff (indels, etc.)
- Add an example use of every term in the OBO file


Suggestions from Gerben to work in proteogenomics explicitly:
•	Include a proteogenomics use case:
	o	add CV for proteogenomics
		?	header CV:
		?	mapping + downstream analysis
		?	(manuscript)
		?	link to ENA-SRA
		?	sequence CV:
		?	chrom location
		?	functional region, start triplet, RF
		?	…
	o	create PEFF writer for proteogenomics DB-creation.
	o	change manuscript to include this proteogenomics use case
•	contact BioPerl/BioPython community to include PEFF format
•	contact Search Engine providers to start supporting PEFF format?
